Shard recovery is the process of initializing a shard copy, such as restoring a
primary shard from a snapshot or creating a replica shard from a primary shard.
When a shard recovery completes, the recovered shard is available for search
and indexing.

Recovery automatically occurs during the following processes:

* When creating an index for the first time (`empty_store`).
* Node startup or failure. This type of recovery is called a local store recovery (`existing_store`).
* Creation of new replica shard copies from the primary (`peer`).
* Relocation of a shard copy to a different node in the same cluster (`peer`).
* A <<snapshots-restore-snapshot,snapshot restore>> operation (`snapshot`).
* A <<indices-clone-index,clone>>, <<indices-shrink-index,shrink>>, or
<<indices-split-index,split>> operation (`local_shards`).

You can determine the cause of a shard recovery using the <<cat-recovery,cat recovery API>>.
