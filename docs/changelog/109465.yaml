  title: Switch to the CLDR locale database when run on JDK 23.
  body: |-
    The COMPAT locale data provider has been removed in JDK23. This means Elasticsearch
    needs to switch to the JDK-provided CLDR locale database when running on
    JDK version 23 and above.

    There are several significant differences between the COMPAT locale database and CLDR,
    largely around day-of-week and month names. This means that if you have date formatters
    that use textual dayor month names, the strings used for parsing and formatting
    may be different when run on JDK 23.
    To ease migration, a shim has been added to maintain the existing era, day-of-week, month,
    and am/pm names from COMPAT, where they differ from CLDR.
    Some aspects of the locale database (eg year quarter names) cannot be overridden in this way.

    For compatibility, COMPAT will continue to be used when Elasticsearch is run on JDK versions 22 and below,
    however this option will be removed in Elasticsearch v9, and only CLDR will be used.
